## Description

### Model

The file QuarterPanelLandscape.SLDASM is a CAD model of the Biosphere model V1.3. The file QuarterPanelLandscape-glassdomain.SLDASM is the same model but used for stress analysis in specific regions. The file QuarterPanelPortrait.SLDASM is the same CAD model but in portrait mounting configuration. 

***Open Solidworks model and Comsol simultaneously and click 'Synchronize' in order for the livelink to work.***

### Optimization

The file RobustimizerBiosphereSolar.opt can be opened in Robustimizer to run the optimization for the Biopshere solar module V1.3. Create a DOE and perform a simulation in Comsol to generate an output file. Upload this output file in Robustimizer.
